# Medium Short Story

This article aims to provide an overview on popular image generation technologies discussed from the paper “[A Survey on Multimodal Deep Learning for Image Synthesis](https://dl-acm-org.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3461353.3461388)”. Five common image synthesis tasks will be focus on along with popular DL models and datasets associated with each. A review on popular evaluation metrics will also be discussed at the end of the article. These tasks are:
* text to image
* scene graph to image
* semantic layout to image
* text-based colorization
* multimodal medical image synthesis
